/*
The access modifiers specifies the accessibility / scope of a field, method, constructor, or class.
There are two types of modifiers in Java: access modifiers and non-access modifiers.
Access Modifiers - controls the access level.
Non-Access Modifiers - do not control access level, but provides other functionality.

There are four types of Java access modifiers:

Private: The access level of a private modifier is only within the class.
		 It cannot be accessed from outside the class.
Default: The access level of a default modifier is only within the package. 
         It cannot be accessed from outside the package. If you do not specify any access level, it will be the default.
Protected:The access level of a protected modifier is within the package and outside the package through child class. 
 		 If you do not make the child class, it cannot be accessed from outside the package.
Public: The access level of a public modifier is everywhere.
		It can be accessed from within the class, outside the class, within the package and outside the package.

There are two types of binding :

1.Static Binding (also known as Early Binding) :
When type of the object is determined at compiled time it is known as static binding.
2.Dynamic Binding (also known as Late Binding) :
When type of the object is determined at run-time it is known as dynamic binding
